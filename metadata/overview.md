Besides a full list with all the available classes and methods, the metadata contains the [JNI](http://developer.android.com/training/articles/perf-jni.html) signature for each accessible method/field. It is pre-generated, in a binary format, and embedded in the application package (apk), storing the minimal required information thus providing small size and highly efficient read access. The generation process uses the Java's [Reflection Mechanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)) to iterate through all the publicly available types.# See Also* [Accessing APIs](./metadata/accessing-packages.md)* [Generating Metadata](./metadata/generator.md)
