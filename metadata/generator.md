# Overview
The metadata is generated by a separate tool, available as an npm package:

```
npm install tns-android-metadata-generator
```

The tool itself is a Java Console application that takes as an input a folder, containing all the JAR packages to traverse. The tool is used by the NativeScript [Command-Line Interface](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli) to enable support for arbitrary third-party Android libraries.
