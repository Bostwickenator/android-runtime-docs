# System Requirements
The recommended ways to create NativeScript Applications is either through the [Command-Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli) or through [Telerik AppBuilder](http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder).

# Supported API Levels
The Android Runtime is built against [API level 17](http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.2.html). The currently available [metadata](../metadata/overview.md) is based on API level 17 and APIs from newer levels are not supported, however applications compatible with API level 17 may be built using any newer API level. Additionally, using the [metadata-generator](../metadata/generator.md) tool you may generate your own metadata for the latest [API level 21](http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-5.0.html).

# Supported Architecture
Currently supported are the following CPU instruction sets:

## armeabi-v7a
This is an ARM-based CPU instruction set that extends the standard set and adds support for hardware floating-point support and multiple CPU cores.

## x86
This is an Application Binary Interface (ABI) that supports the instruction set commonly named *x86* or *IA-32*.

## x64
Coming soon
